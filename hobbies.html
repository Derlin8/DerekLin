									<h1>My Hobbies and Interests
									</h1>
									<p>Right now, I devote most of my time to coursework and endurance running. I run track and cross country for the NCAA team here at UC Davis
									in addition to pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Davis.jpg" alt="" /></div>
							
								<p>This is my third year at UC Davis and I am incredibly grateful to have met great friends through my classes and athletic activities. With the pandemic causing the institution to adapt to remote learning, it has been a unique experience meeting others through classes. Similarly, the past track and cross country seasons have both been cancelled due to the pandemic. Although there has not been meets, the team has been practicing social distancing and mandatory mask protocols in order to quarantining in a pseudo-bubble here in Davis. This has permitted my teammates and I to continue training and partcipating in team hosted time trials. So while competition has been cancelled, the grind still continues. I am grateful to be able to run, as it allows me to get out of the house once in a while, taking a break from my Zoom classes. </p>

								<p>Besides running and programming, hobbies of mine include playing chess, playing League of Legends, cooking (particularly East Asian dishes), photography, and beekeeping.</p>
								<p>Here are some photos that showcase my interests </p>
								
								
								<p>Starting in 2019, my older brother became interested in raising colonies of bees. Over the past few years, we have harvested numerous pounds of honey. </p>

								<p>The above images are supers, short for superstructures. These boxes are placed on a beehive for bees to store honey.</p>

								<p> My older brother, David, posing with a photo of the aftermath of churning the uncapped (we cut the wax) super from supers into raw honey. </p>
								
								<p> Here are some photos of food I've made the past few months. </p>

								<p> Over the summer, I peaked at around #40 in North America in my favorite videogame called League of Legends. The game Mode I play is called Teamfight Tactics, which deviates from the traditional 5v5 format, taking less mechanical skill (reflexes and motor skills). TFT (Teamfight Tactics) is sometimes called auto-chess as it uses more decision-making capabilities. Here is a photo of me reaching the coveted challenger rank in TFT, which is the top 100 in the North America server.</p>

								<p> If you haven't played chess before, you should try this website called chess.com, where most players can play against others across the world. I have played thousands of games and reached a rating of 1440 so far. I am still far from the top, but will continue to play and improve! Here's a link to my <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/budgetninja">profile</a>on chess.com, </p>
