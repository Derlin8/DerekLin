 									<p> The past few days I worked with my partner, Andrew, to create a hackathon project, a web app that generates running routes based on location and fitness level for the user. The theme for the hackathon was to hack for social good. With the ongoing pandemic and remote learning and work, many people find themselves confined to their homes. Exercise is good for mental health, sleep, and reducing stress. Furthermore, running is a beginner-friendly activity for most individuals. We wanted to create an app that would encourage others to exercise. <br> Our initial plan was to use Strava’s API on GitHub to find popular running routes, but we found that their API to extract popular routes was unavailable to the public. We then decided to narrow down our focus to the Davis and Sacramento area because we had access to my gpx files that had routes accumulated the past few years. We hit a major setback trying to parse the gpx files into loadable routes onto the google maps API. We are currently trying to find a fix for this. We have been looking at Leaflet, another gpx converter for webpages. We also are currently trying to use javascript libraries as well as python libraries to parse the gpx files into routes, but to no avail. If anyone has any expertise, please let us know. Otherwise, we will be trying to implement this next feature within the coming weeks. <br> Overall, this has been a great experience, as this was my first hackathon. Prior to this weekend, I had never heard of Flask. And now I know that is a python based web framework used to support the backend of applications. We also used React, a javascript library for building user interfaces. Collaborating with Andrew made me realize how ubiquitous version control is. It was my first time using GitHub while working with a partner and using version control was a must. I also want to become more familiar with the terminal and Unix in general as I realize that computer science is not just programming, but understanding the mechanizations of computing and machines. <br> With the hackathon being virtual, it was still an interactive experience and I am glad to have been a part of it. I learned a lot and it has definitely piqued my interests in exploring software and its effects on solving real world problems. I recommend others to try these new experiences, even if they have had no prior expertise. I still consider myself a beginner when it comes to programming, but the community has been really helpful. At the end of the day, I believe that programming comes down to problem solving, a skill that can be trained and mastered. Furthermore, these skills are developed over time and not necessarily over night. It’s easy to get discouraged, but I want to focus on the long term results.

									<p> Finished my quarantine period and got my negative test results back, so I was officially cleared to practice. But UC Davis is suspending athletic activities until the 20th. While it is a bummer, it makes the most sense. With cases reaching up to 300,000 per day in the US and 22,000,000 cases in the US so far, I’m not surprised at all actually. With multiple friends catching COVID and my older brother catching it, it’s tough to believe going to practice is the right thing to do - from my personal standpoint. Further, it seems that the NCAA continuing their activities would be quite tone-deaf and detrimental. In a way, I have been enjoying the time away from practice. I feel as if I have been more invested in my academics, career opportunities, and side projects. I hope the vaccines become distributed soon and also hope they are effective against any mutations.

									<p> The past few days, I’ve been living alone in my apartment in Davis. While only a short period of time, but with only virtual interaction with others, I have definitely realized the mental toll the pandemic has on individuals. It has made me foster a greater appreciation with my relationships with family and close friends. Additionally, it has also given me time to self-reflect over the past few years and my plans for the future. During this time confined in my quarantine, I have spent a lot of time on the internet, and haven't been the most productive. Making matters worse, it has also been a dark time in the US as protestors stormed the capitol building last Wednesday, January 6th. I have felt abnormally sluggish and low in energy, noticable in everyday activity, especially during my running. I hope the next time I contribute to this blog, things will be better and the hard times pass.

									<p> It has been extremely fun and rewarding to learn to write CSS and HTML code, as well as learn more about the GitHub Pages API to host this website. I wish to post on this blog weekly about my unfiltered thoughts, experiences, and viewpoints. As of today, I am living in Davis, California amid the pandemic, finishing up week 1 of the Winter Quarter. I am on my fourth day of quarantine before returning to NCAA practice for track. I am looking forward to reuniting with my teammates and to continue to get some runs in! If you haven't already, check out my <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/33128223">strava</a> to see my daily routes. I also use <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/derek-lin-ucd">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Derlin8">GitHub</a>.
