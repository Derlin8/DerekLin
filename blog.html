									<p> The past few days, Iâ€™ve been living alone in my apartment in Davis. While only a short period of time, but with only virtual interaction with others, I have definitely realized the mental toll the pandemic has on individuals. It has made me foster a greater appreciation with my relationships with family and close friends. Additionally, it has also given me time to self-reflect over the past few years and my plans for the future. During this time confined in my quarantine, I have spent a lot of time on the internet, and haven't been the most productive. Making matters worse, it has also been a dark time in the US as protestors stormed the capitol building last Wednesday, January 6th. I have felt abnormally sluggish and low in energy, noticable in everyday activity, especially during my endurance training. I hope the next time I contribute to this blog, things will be better and the hard times pass.

									<p> It has been extremely fun and rewarding to learn to write CSS and HTML code, as well as learn more about the GitHub Pages API to host this website. I wish to post on this blog weekly about my unfiltered thoughts, experiences, and viewpoints. As of today, I am living in Davis, California amid the pandemic, finishing up week 1 of the Winter Quarter. I am on my fourth day of quarantine before returning to NCAA practice for track. I am looking forward to reuniting with my teammates and to continue to get some runs in! If you haven't already, check out my <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/33128223">strava</a> to see my daily routes. I also use <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/derek-lin-ucd">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Derlin8">GitHub</a>.
