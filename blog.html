									<p> Here's an essay I wrote for one of my classes, it's been on my mind for a while. There are a few sources I quoted from, one was a film about Cambodian refugees from Lowell, Massachusetts. Another was an article about a high school from Sacramento. Another source was about the Model Minority Myth. I hope you find this insightful.
									<br> <br>
									During the summer of 2018 my freshman year, I watched a highly anticipated film called Crazy Rich Asians. It was a romantic comedy that starred a majority Asian cast. The movie was enjoyable and while I don’t quite remember the plot, it was a ton of fun. Similar to Marvel’s “Black Panther,” seeing representation given to minorities in the entertainment industry felt like a breath of fresh air. However, looking back at the movie, I believe that Crazy Rich Asians' could be actually detrimental to how Asians are perceived in America. Like the title suggests, the movie assumes the stereotype that Asians are well off, feeding into the model minority myth that Asians as a whole are affluent and successful, deemed as not “true” minorities. This could not be more far wrong, and I believe that Crazy Rich Asians unintentionally contributes to the racial overtones of the Model Minority Myth and how many view Asians through a colorblind lens. Similar to this analogy of Crazy Rich Asians, this essay will focus on the misrepresentation of the heterogeneity and struggles of Asian Americans through the model minority myth and the negative effects of colorblindness through a legal strategist, Edward Blum, and his lawsuit against Harvard’s Affirmative Action. 
									<br> <br>	
									While some may argue that the concept of being the Model Minority may be an advantage for Asians, this distorted reality highlights the success of a few, undercutting the struggles of the majority of marginalized Asians. Many fail to realize that Asian Americans are the most economically divided racial group in the country. In Moriah Balingit’s article from the Washington Post written in 2019, Balingit analyzes the model minority myth and provides key points to refutes the myth. Balingit states that the wealthiest 10 percent earning more than 10 times the amount of the poorest 10 percent of Asian Americans. The highest earners tend to skew the average for the rest of the group. Additionally, Asian Americans have the highest poverty rate in NYC, dispelling the notion that all Asians are financially well off. In my hometown Sacramento, California, more than three-quarters of students at Luther Burbank High School qualify for free lunches and a fifth of students at Burbank are from households where the main language is Hmong (Balingit, 2019). At Burbank, most of these students do not fit the stereotypical “Crazy Rich Asians” mold with 4.0 GPA aspirations. They are struggling to juggle schoolwork and Hmong traditions such as taking care of their family. For many, college is an afterthought, as their parents want them to stay at home to take care of the family. Thus, many Hmong Americans find themselves in the middle of not being quite the “right” kind of Asian, yet unable to benefit from being viewed as a “true person of color” such as Hispanic or Black. This article relates to Julie Mallozzi’s Monkey Dance, a documentary about Cambodian teens growing up in Lowell, Massachusetts. The film centers around high school teenagers living in impoverished homes families that were torn apart and fleeing from the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. These teens do not get the benefit of being a prosperous “model minority” yet are lumped into the category of being a “Crazy Rich Asian.” Through various case studies of teenagers whether they are Cambodian immigrants in Lowell or Hmong Americans in Sacramento, we see concrete examples that dispute the homogeneity of the model minority myth, where lumping Asians together erases the heterogeneity of a multitude of different cultures, rendering color-blind perceptions of Asians.
									<br> <br> 	
									The model minority narrative dispels the notion of opportunities seized that were only applicable because of Asian American grassroots movements and Civil Rights movements in the 1960s. In Vijay Prashad’s Karma of Brown Folk, Prashad talks about the dangers of the model minority myth and its uses to cause infighting within Asians and pit them against other ethnic minority groups. Prashad talks about how the immigration act and nationality act of 1965 led to new economic opportunities and an influx of well-educated and prosperous immigrants. Thus, in believing the model minority myth, critics censor missing factors in analysis of the success of Asian American in the 1980s: the legacy of grassroots organizations that cushioned the war on poor in Asian American communities and the rise of young professionals who benefited from desegregation and education opportunities as a result of civil rights and the Asian American movement in the 1960s that helped create new organizations and electoral politics (Prashad, 70). Embracing the model minority narrative is detrimental and illustrates a faulty narrative that exploits Asians and other ethnic minorities as a whole, while simultaneously turning its back on the foundation of what made the minority of Asians successful in the first place.
									<br> <br> 	
									Moreover, in the 1980’s a socio-economically empowered class of Asian Americans, primarily South and East Asians, who were able to assimilate and benefit from the grassroot organizations and desegregation movements attributed from the civil rights movement began to rise. However, this “empowered” class of Asians mostly consisted of young professionals that focused on individual empowerment, rather than collective advancement. Many Asian Americans shifted towards neoconservatism, claiming pride but critical of ethical movements and affirmative actions, yet they themselves were products of affirmative action. Many opposed racial discriminations but paradoxically argued that discrimination is due to cultural differences from deficient minority groups (Prashad, 75). The new “empowered” group of Asian Americans found socio-economic success and were successfully used as a wedge from white supremacists to undo the effects of the Asian American and Civil Rights movements a few decades earlier.
									<br> <br> 	
									The famous lawsuit against Harvard was spearheaded by an anti-affirmative action legal strategist, Edward Blum, is an example of how the model minority myth drives a wedge between minorities, particularly Asians against Hispanics and Blacks. In 2013, Blum attempted to sue the University of Texas on behalf of a white woman because of race-conscious decision-making in college admissions. When this didn’t work, he sought to find Asian plaintiffs. Blum argued that discriminating against Asians in the admission process is unfair, which may raise a fair point. Since the college admissions seems opaque, it may make more sense to be more conscious of socio-economic status as a better indicator of trials and tribulations of an individual’s hard work and grit. However, Blum argues that individuals should be measured not based on their ethnicity but based on their merit. However, eliminating race from the admissions process only takes away from the individual who is applying and the story that comes from who they really are. Blum’s use of strategically rallying Chinese Americans as representative as the entirety of Asian Americans doesn’t do justice for the Asian community he seemingly represents. Blum simply wants a colorblind system, erasing the Asian American identity. Blum uses both the model minority trope and color blindness to seek to abolish Affirmative Action, an act that would hurt minorities, including Asian Americans like the Cambodian and Hmong immigrants mentioned earlier.
									<br> <br> 	
									The model minority myth is dangerous for both Asians and other minorities as it drives a wedge between each other, while contributing to the negative effects of colorblindness. A persistent stereotype that paints all Asian Americans as well off and successful could not be more far off from the truth. Furthermore, it fuels anti-Asian hatred and racism from other minorities based on jealousy. Meanwhile, whites see Asians as not needing attention or help because of the notion that Asians are living the “American Dream.” Furthermore, it hurts South Asian, Pacific Islander, and Southwest Asians, as many of these types of Asian Americans do not conform to the rare, fetishized East Asian success stories depicted in fairy tale stories such as Crazy Rich Asians.	
									<br> <br> 	
									Crazy Rich Asians and the Harvard Affirmative Action Lawsuit have similarities where they unintentionally exacerbate the harmful effects of colorblindness and the model minority myth. The notion that Asians as a whole is homogeneously successful could not be more far from the truth. Like other minorities, Asians struggle economically, and their ethnicity is a big part of their life. Even if they do succeed economically, their ethnicity plays a huge part of their lives. As of right now, Asians are being targeted because of COVID-19 and hate crimes have increased by over 150% in many cities such as NYC and San Francisco. A color-blind society would do much more harm than good. Edward Blum’s crusade against Affirmative Action only upholds the status quo for white supremacy and pits Asian Americans against other minorities, furthering his own agenda. Abolishing Affirmative Action would contribute to a colorblind society while simultaneously supporting the detrimental effects of the model minority myth.

									<p> On June 19th 1982, a Chinese American engineering technician, Vincent Chin, was at the wrong place at the wrong time. Two men, Ronald Ebens and his stepson Michael Nitz, encountered Chin at a local strip club in Highland Park, Michigan for Chin’s bachelor party. A few years earlier, Nitz, an automobile worker, had been laid off. In the midst of anti-Japanese resentment, Nitz took his anger out at Chin, whom he mistakenly thought was Japanese. Chin and his friends ended up in a brawl with Ebens and Nitz and the scuffle escalated outside of the venue. Shortly after, Ebens and Nitz retrieved a baseball from their car and chased Chin and one of his friends out of the parking lot. Eventually, Nitz and Ebens found Chin at a nearby McDonald’s restaurant. Held down by Nitz, Ebens repeatedly bashed Chin in the head with the baseball bat. When a policeman arrived at the scene, it was said that “Ebens was swinging the bat like he was swinging for a home run.” Chin died four days after in a coma. 
									
									<br> <br> 
									Ebens was arrested and taken into custody at the scene of the crime by off-duty officers who witnessed the beating. Both Ebens and Nitz were convicted of manslaughter rather than second-degree murder. Ebens and Nitz served no jail tome and were given three years’ probation, fined $3000. A quote from Judge Charles Kaufman, who charged the two with manslaughter: “These weren’t the kind of men you send to jail…You don’t make the punishment fit the crime; you make the punishment fit the criminal.” Essentially issued a $3000 warrant to murder a Chinese man, Ebens and Nitz were able to live the rest of their free lives. Considered an obvious hate crime by many, the US justice system yet again failed the Asian-American community. 									
									<br> <br> 
									Incidents like the murder of John Chin are still very indicative of the current climate of Anti-Asian hate — Asian Americans are treated as “perpetual foreigners” in contrast to “real Americans.” A quote from Lily Chin, the mother of Vincent Chin speaks volumes of this hypocrisy: "What kind of law is this? What kind of justice? This happened because my son is Chinese. If two Chinese killed a white person, they must go to jail, maybe for their whole lives... Something is wrong with this country."

 									<p> A year ago, I saw a jarring video of an Asian elder collecting cans from the street. The point of view showed a mob of people, of all ages, verbally and physically assaulting the elder while security guards watched idly. This took place in a community within San Fransisco, and was around the same time that COVID-19 began to pop in the United States. Watching that video left a feeling of helplessness in myself for a long time. I stopped looking at social media for a few weeks, trying especially hard to avoid the news and incidents like that. Unfortunately, fast forward to more than a year later, and cases of Anti-Asian hate crimes have apparently spiked by 150% in major U.S cities like New York, SF, Los Angeles, etc. Incidents where Asian people, especially the elderly, are spit on, pushed onto the ground, slashed in the face, killed, are all too common to avoid. I ask myself, what if this happened to my parents or my grandparents? 
										
									<br> <br> 
									Like many Asian-Americans, I can attest that I have faced my fair share of problems and have been subjected to harmful stereotypes, however I have never been physically assualted. Since COVID-19 reached the United States, problems have only been exacerbated, and it pains me that it has been over a year and there still has not been as much media coverage or repercussions for agitators of these crimes. While I believe the Asian-American community has not done a good job of being outwardly supportive for other minorities as they should, this does not justify hate crimes against them. There are little to no hate crimes instigated by Asian-Americans. So why are Asian-Americans being targeted? Well there was the racist rhetoric spewed from our former president, but there has always been false, harmful stereotypes such as Asian-Americans believed to be meek, anti-conflictive, and passive. With little to no media coverage and false beliefs, Asian-Americans have been easy targets for violence and hatred. 
									<br> <br> 
									Besides COVID, this is not the first time Asian-Americans have been scapegoated due to a domestic crisis. There’s the Chinese Exclusion Act, Japanese Internment Camps, the murder of Vincent Chin in 1982, post 9-11 hate crimes against people that looked Muslim, etc. Furthermore, the concept of the “model minority” serves to further cause a wedge between Asian-Americans and other minorities. The common theme of harassing an underrepresented community and facing little to no repercussions perpetuate more ammunition for the assaulters. It’s been over a year since I watched that horrific video, and it seems wrong of me to remain silent while matters get worse. I may not be the most politically active nor correct, so I would love to have a discussion with others who disagree or would like to fill in gaps on what I have missed.

 									<p> The past few days I worked with my partner, Andrew, to create a hackathon project, a web app that generates running routes based on location and fitness level for the user. The theme for the hackathon was to hack for social good. With the ongoing pandemic and remote learning and work, many people find themselves confined to their homes. Exercise is good for mental health, sleep, and reducing stress. Furthermore, running is a beginner-friendly activity for most individuals. We wanted to create an app that would encourage others to exercise. <br> <br> Our initial plan was to use Strava’s API on GitHub to find popular running routes, but we found that their API to extract popular routes was unavailable to the public. We then decided to narrow down our focus to the Davis and Sacramento area because we had access to my gpx files that had routes accumulated the past few years. We hit a major setback trying to parse the gpx files into loadable routes onto the google maps API. We are currently trying to find a fix for this. We have been looking at Leaflet, another gpx converter for webpages. We also are currently trying to use javascript libraries as well as python libraries to parse the gpx files into routes, but to no avail. If anyone has any expertise, please let us know. Otherwise, we will be trying to implement this next feature within the coming weeks. <br> <br> Overall, this has been a great experience, as this was my first hackathon. Prior to this weekend, I had never heard of Flask. And now I know that is a python based web framework used to support the backend of applications. We also used React, a javascript library for building user interfaces. Collaborating with Andrew made me realize how ubiquitous version control is. It was my first time using GitHub while working with a partner and using version control was a must. I also want to become more familiar with the terminal and Unix in general as I realize that computer science is not just programming, but understanding the mechanizations of computing and machines. <br> With the hackathon being virtual, it was still an interactive experience and I am glad to have been a part of it. I learned a lot and it has definitely piqued my interests in exploring software and its effects on solving real world problems. I recommend others to try these new experiences, even if they have had no prior expertise. I still consider myself a beginner when it comes to programming, but the community has been really helpful. At the end of the day, I believe that programming comes down to problem solving, a skill that can be trained and mastered. Furthermore, these skills are developed over time and not necessarily over night. It’s easy to get discouraged, but I want to focus on the long term results.

									<p> Finished my quarantine period and got my negative test results back, so I was officially cleared to practice. But UC Davis is suspending athletic activities until the 20th. While it is a bummer, it makes the most sense. With cases reaching up to 300,000 per day in the US and 22,000,000 cases in the US so far, I’m not surprised at all actually. With multiple friends catching COVID and my older brother catching it, it’s tough to believe going to practice is the right thing to do - from my personal standpoint. Further, it seems that the NCAA continuing their activities would be quite tone-deaf and detrimental. In a way, I have been enjoying the time away from practice. I feel as if I have been more invested in my academics, career opportunities, and side projects. I hope the vaccines become distributed soon and also hope they are effective against any mutations.

									<p> The past few days, I’ve been living alone in my apartment in Davis. While only a short period of time, but with only virtual interaction with others, I have definitely realized the mental toll the pandemic has on individuals. It has made me foster a greater appreciation with my relationships with family and close friends. Additionally, it has also given me time to self-reflect over the past few years and my plans for the future. During this time confined in my quarantine, I have spent a lot of time on the internet, and haven't been the most productive. Making matters worse, it has also been a dark time in the US as protestors stormed the capitol building last Wednesday, January 6th. I have felt abnormally sluggish and low in energy, noticable in everyday activity, especially during my running. I hope the next time I contribute to this blog, things will be better and the hard times pass.

									<p> It has been extremely fun and rewarding to learn to write CSS and HTML code, as well as learn more about the GitHub Pages API to host this website. I wish to post on this blog weekly about my unfiltered thoughts, experiences, and viewpoints. As of today, I am living in Davis, California amid the pandemic, finishing up week 1 of the Winter Quarter. I am on my fourth day of quarantine before returning to NCAA practice for track. I am looking forward to reuniting with my teammates and to continue to get some runs in!
